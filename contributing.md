# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the VPCI Clubs Website! We're hoping that this website will be a project maintained by the school's Coding Club.

While you don't need any prior coding experience to learn how to maintain the website, the technologies used in the website are vastly different than the technologies taught in the school's computer science curriculum. You'll need to make sure that you're ready to invest time in learning new technologies outside of school in order to be able to contribute to the website. If you already have some programming experience, but not sure if it transfers over to developing the website, here is a list of the technologies used by the VPCI Clubs Website:

## Frontend Technologies

**HTML**: You'll need to learn the basics of HTML syntax

**CSS**: You'll also need to learn some CSS, especially CSS Flexbox (which is heavily used throughout this website).

- **TailwindCSS** TailwindCSS is a CSS framework that allows us to specify CSS styles in the HTML directly, which makes working with CSS (especially responsible styling) much easier.

**JavaScript**: JavaScript is heavily used in this website for the interactive parts, so you'll need to learn the basics of JavaScript.

- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds types to catch common errors like typos and passing invalid types while you're writing the code. You don't necessarily need to learn how to write TypeScript, but rather just understanding the basics of the syntax.

**Vue 3**: The framework we're using to build vpciclubs.com is Vue (specifically Vue 3). Vue makes it extremely easy to make sync state to the HTML using regular HTML, CSS and JavaScript syntax.

- **Composition API**
- **Vue Router**
- **Vite**
- **Pinia**
- **React Snap**

### npm packages

**fullcalendar/@core**: Used for the event calendar.
**fullcalendar/daygrid**: The [DayGrid view]() is the main view of the calender [DayGrid View]
**fullcalendar/timegrid**: The optional [TimeGrid view](https://fullcalendar.io/docs/timegrid-view) for the events calendar.
**@mdi/js**: The path for all Material Design Community Icons
**@popperjs/core**: A tooltip positioning system.
**@sinclair/typebox**: A way to define both TypeScript types and JSON Schema validation schemas to pass to a validator like ajv.
**animate.css**: A library that provides easy-to-use animations.
**array-shuffle**: An npm package that randomizes the order of elements in an array (used in the club gallery).
**autolinker**: A library that takes text and automatically creates links (as HTML &lt;a&gt; tags) based on the text (e.g. detecting URLs, mentions, etc.)
**csstype**: Typescript typings for CSS properties.
***dompurify**: A library for sanitizing HTML to prevent XSS attacks.
**ky**: A simple HTTP library for making requests from the frontend.
**pinia**: A state management library for Vue.js
**shave**: A library that automatically trims text (by ending it with ...) depending on the size of the parent element.
**vue**: The package for vue.
**vue-router**: The official router for navigating pages in a Vue website.
**windicss**: A CSS framework based on TailwindCSS that provides additional features and integrates better with Vite.
