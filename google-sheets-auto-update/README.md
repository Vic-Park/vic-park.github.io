# Google Sheets Auto Update

This is a service that reads the contents from a Google Sheets and programmatically updates the data files in the repository using the GitHub API.

This service was deliberately created in a way that makes it an optional service (i.e. not necessary for the functioning of the main website). This is the reason why we didn't just dynamically load the data from the Google Sheets every time the page was loaded; this would cause the website to become dependent on this service, violating the constraint of independenceâ€”should the backend server malfunction, the main website will also end up breaking.

## Elements

The two main elements of this service are the backend (which should be hosted on a cloud service like Heroku), and the Google Apps Script (which should be attached to a Google Sheets).

## Flow

1. To activate the service, an editor of the Google Sheets (which would likely be a staff member) would run the Google Apps Script.
2. The Google Apps Script prompts the staff member for a secret that only they (and inevitably the user who hosts the backend) should know.
3. The script will then send a post request to the backend service along with the data in the Google Sheets
4. The backend verifies that the secret is valid.
5. The backend then parses the data retrieved from the Google Sheets, and compares them to the files currently active on the repository.
6. If changes were detected between the Google Sheets' data and the repository, the backend will then programmatically update files in the repository, making sure only to trigger the GitHub Actions on the last file that needs to be updated.
7. The GitHub actions workflow will automatically be run and will re-build and update the main site.
