Math club is hosting a school party! Free pizza for everyone! Also teachers get pied in the face! And everyone gets to do contest math problems!

Join us on June 31st!

(I'm kidding. This is fake. It's a placeholder announcement to demonstrate how annoucements will work. Please don't get mad at me.)
