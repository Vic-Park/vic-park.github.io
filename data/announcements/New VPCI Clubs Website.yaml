  This is our school's very own, brand-new VPCI Clubs website! Here you can find
  information about all of the various clubs that VPCI offers. Navigate to the
  Club List by clicking the link on the top right. The Club List lists all the
  clubs, and if you click on one, you will be brought to that club's homepage. A
  Club's homepage contains information which will help you decide whether you
  want to join that club. (Soon, there will even be a link to a signup form!).
  If you find any bugs, or if you have suggestions for this website, please
  contact the programming club leaders.
