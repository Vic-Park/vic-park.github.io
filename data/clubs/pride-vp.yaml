  Pride VP runs all year long and there is no specific time commitment required
  to participate. Our goal is to create a safe and welcoming environment for
  students, so you can come to all our meetings and help plan events, or just
  drop in occasionally.
equityStatement: >-
  [At Pride VP, our goal is to spread love and positivity while building
  community. We strive to create a safe and welcoming space where students of
  all identities feel comfortable being themselves.] In our meetings, we try to
  keep an inclusive and friendly environment where everyone's thoughts and ideas
  are valued. We build community through various small events where students are
  able to connect with one another and have fun. Simultaneously, we work to keep
  the school community educated on lgbtq+ events and history, and raise
  awareness for relevant issues faced by 2SLGBT+ youth within and outside of our
  community.
