shortDescription: >-
  Devoted into protecting the environment and maintaining a green planet,
  Victoria Parkâ€™s ECO Council is a great place to explore and learn about new
  ways of improving our climate, meet more people who have the same concerns as
  you about the environment, and gain volunteer hours too!  We believe that
  every action, no matter how small, can make a difference.
