equityStatement: >-
  [VP’s Christian Fellowship aims to create a welcoming and inclusive space for
  all staff and students interested in learning about who God is and what it
  means to have a relationship with Jesus.] At our meetings, every member is
  invited to share whatever’s on their heart, whether that be profound joy found
  in God, questions about who He is, or even dark moments in their spiritual
  journey. At our Bible studies and topical workshops, we aim to share the
  teachings of Jesus in an interactive, engaging and meaningful way so all of us
  can grow to love Him more.
