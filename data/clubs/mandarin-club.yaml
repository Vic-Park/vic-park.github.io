shortDescription: >-
  This club is for students who are interested in Chinese culture and are
  willing to learn something special after school, we are also hosting in club
  events and activities every other week. The mandarin club was originally for
  gathering Chinese international students and help them to blend in the
  community faster, now with more and more people coming in, I think we can do
  much more such as holding university, mental health, driver's test venues
  information session, volunteering and fund raising for environmental
  protection organizations.
