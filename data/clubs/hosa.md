  prepare students for the 30+ events that are held at the annual Spring
  Leadership Conference by HOSA Canada.

  Most of the time, it is the competitorâ€™s responsibility to individually study
  the material for an event (in other words, the more time you invest, the more
  successful you will be!) We will accommodate those that require a more
  instructional approach to the HOSA competition. Our club runs from the
  beginning of the year up until late spring.
