  [Amnesty International VPâ€™s goal is to create a safe space for students and
  staff to educate themselves on global social injustices and take action. By
  creating an environment where everyone feels welcome, regardless of their
  identity, we can give people the chance to start their journey of activism.]
  Amnesty thinks it is extremely important for everyone to recognize their
  privilege and not to speak over the communities we advocate for. Doing our
  best to pursue this promotes equity.
