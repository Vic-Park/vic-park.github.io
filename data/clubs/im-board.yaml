  [The “I’m Board” club aims to battle various mental health issues present at
  this school, such as depression, stress and, of course, boredom. How we plan
  to do this is we will provide a safe stress-free space in which we play a
  variety of board and card games, such as Monopoly, Chess, UNO, etc.] We will
  also teach our members new games, ones that aren’t as widely known as the ones
  listed above, as a way to incorporate education in the fun. Further, we will
  also play a Kahoot every week, in which the winner gets a prize.
