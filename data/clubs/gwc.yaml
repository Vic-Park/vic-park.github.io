  [Girls Who Codeâ€™s mission is to create a safe and encouraging environment for
  all students (regardless of gender or skill) to pursue their interests! We
  strive to ensure that everyone is heard and that their concerns are
  addressed.] Computer science is often male dominated, which means gender
  minorities often do not get the support they need to pursue computer science.
  We hope that we can provide everyone with the same opportunities!
