  [The purpose of the VPCI Gardening club is to not only foster a love of
  gardening but to also demonstrate that there are alternatives to grass in
  public spaces. Gardening goes beyond the bounds of race, creed, or religion
  and is something that all peoples in all countries and all cultures do.] Thus,
  we work to include as many types of agricultural understanding and methods as
  we can. All students are welcome and all ideas are considered.
