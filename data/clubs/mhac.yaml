  MHAC hosts weekly initiatives such as themed Wellness Wednesdays and Resource
  Highlights.  We also provide resources, share updates, host giveaways, lead
  school wide events (i.e. Workshop Day) and partner with other school
  committees on shared projects.  To better educate ourselves and support each
  other, members of MHAC engage regularly in workshops, training, conversation
  and self-care practices that enhance our understanding of the benefits of
  mental health for everyone.  Our workshops and training sessions are provided
  by the TDSB and outside organizations. All of our events and campaigns are
  shared via announcements and social media.  Our goal is to support each other
  and the VPCI community in their mental health journeys.

equityStatement: >-
  [VPCI’s Mental Health Awareness Council aims to create an inclusive  space for
  ALL students and staff to raise awareness of and eliminate the stigma
  surrounding mental health.] At MHAC, we strive to provide equal opportunities
  for students from all grade levels and programs. We do this by creating an
  environment that encourages and responds to student voice and is reflective of
  students of all diverse areas and multiple identities. We practice equity in
  both our meetings and training workshops by encouraging participation based on
  everyone’s strengths and comfort levels when working on initiatives, and
  hosting discussions where all members’ opinions are valued.
