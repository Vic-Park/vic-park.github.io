  MHAC hosts weekly initiatives, our most well known one being themed Wellness
  Wednesdays. We also provide resources, share updates, host giveaways, lead
  school wide events such as Workshop Day and collab with other school
  committees on shared projects. To better educate ourselves and support each
  other, MHAC members regularly  engage in workshops and training (provided by
  the TDSB and outside organizations), discussions, and self-care practices that
  enhance our understanding of the benefits of mental health for everyone. All
  of our events and campaigns are shared via announcements and social media. Our
  goal is to support each other and the VPCI community in their mental health
  journeys.

  [VPCI’s Mental Health Awareness Council aims to create an inclusive space for
  ALL students and staff to raise awareness of and eliminate the stigma
  surrounding mental health.] At MHAC, we strive to provide equal opportunities
  for students from all grade levels and programs. We do this by creating an
  environment that encourages and responds to student voice and is reflective of
  students of all diverse areas and multiple identities. We practice equity in
  both our meetings and training workshops by encouraging participation based on
  everyone’s strengths and comfort levels when working on initiatives, and
  hosting discussions where all members’ opinions are valued.
