  [FBLA emphasizes the expression of passion for business with their peers. We
  value members' voices and wish to ensure an enriching experience by increasing
  the exposure in the field of business to the student body at Victoria Park
  CI.] Meetings are always interactive to encourage active learning, and
  exploration of the field of business outside of the competition. We are always
  open to ideas to develop opportunities, and we want to ensure that
  opportunities are given to all VP students.
